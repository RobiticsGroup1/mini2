PROJECT: Doosan E0509 Pick & Place Task Redesign (Manager-based)
================================================================================

1. REPOSITORY OVERVIEW
   - Target Repo: RobiticsGroup1/mini2
   - Current Task: 'e0509_pick' (Picking and placing objects)
   - Current Implementation: DirectRLEnv (Monolithic approach)

2. CORE OBJECTIVE
   - Fully transition from DirectRLEnv to the Manager-based RLEnv (Isaac Lab standard).
   - Aim for modularity, scalability, and cleaner reward/observation management.

3. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN (Manager-based)

   A. Scene Configuration (SceneCfg)
      - Asset: Doosan E0509 (URDF/Mesh from repo)
      - Object: Manipulation target (Cube/Box)
      - Ground Plane & Table setup
      - Sensors: Contact sensors for gripper pads, Frame markers for EE/Object

   B. Observation Manager (ObsManager)
      - Robot State: Joint positions, velocities, and EE pose.
      - Task State: Object pose, relative distance/orientation between EE and Object.
      - History: Previous actions for temporal context.

   C. Reward Manager (RewManager)
      - Approach Term: Penalty/Reward based on distance to object.
      - Grasp Term: Binary/Continuous reward for successful contact & grip.
      - Lift Term: Reward for increasing Z-height of the object.
      - Goal Term: Reward for matching object pose with target pose.
      - Regularization: Penalties for high joint torque or sudden movements.

   D. Termination Manager (TermManager)
      - Success: Object reached target within threshold.
      - Failure: Object fell off table, self-collision, or timeout.

   E. Event Manager
      - Randomization: Randomized spawning for robot joints and object pose.

4. NEXT ACTION STEPS for Gemini CLI
   - Step 1: Generate 'e0509_pick_env_cfg.py' skeleton (ManagerBasedRLEnvCfg).
   - Step 2: Define specialized reward functions in a separate 'rewards.py'.
   - Step 3: Configure Action Manager for Inverse Kinematics (IK) control.
   - Step 4: Update training script to register and run the new v2 environment.
